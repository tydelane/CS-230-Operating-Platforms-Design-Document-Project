The Gaming Room is a client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) that needed to expand their game, “Draw it or Lost it” from Android to include other platforms. They came to CTS for a consultation on the best way to approach this goal, and to have software developed that will be used to simulate various platform options for the client. I believe my best contribution to this project was my understanding and communication of the software requirements, design constraints and evaluation of the various platforms that could be utilized to achieve their goals. Firstly, the requirements were communicated very well and were separated into categories related to business and technical requirements. Furthermore, the design constraints were well thought out and the technology evaluation was in-depth. I thought it was very helpful not only getting to become familiar with the layout of a design document, but also how each section relates to various aspects of the code and how various components work together. If I could choose one part of the document to revise, it would be the recommendations section, because I feel it could have been more thorough.  While I included many pros and cons in the design document table, I think I could have communicated them better. Furthermore, the recommendations could have been more thought out by having access to more information regarding the user, company, and product needs. To improve, I would conduct more research and develop more clearly defined requirements. To interpret the user’s needs, I studied the information given, separating it into details related to certain aspects of the overall goal. This is important because the requirements must be well defined and the requirements should be easy to communicate to the team, as well as test throughout the entire process. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing the software because the usability of the software will affect the value the company provides to the customer/user. If the user finds the software difficult to use or there are too many defects, they may seek to do business with a company that has more intuitive software.
